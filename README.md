## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Clinical-Guidance-System.git
   cd Clinical-Guidance-System
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **Alternative manual installation:**
   ```bash
   pip install Flask==2.3.3 pandas==2.1.1 scikit-learn==1.3.0 numpy==1.24.3
   ```

4. **Verify dataset files**
   Ensure all CSV files are present in the `dataset/` directory:
   - description.csv
   - diets.csv
   - disease_info.csv
   - disease_symptom_summary.csv
   - medications.csv
   - precautions_df.csv
   - symtoms_df.csv
   - updated_training.csv
   - workout_df.csv

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Algorithm Details

### Prediction Methodology

The system uses a multi-factor scoring algorithm that considers:

1. **Symptom Matching (70% weight)**
   - Compares user symptoms against disease-specific symptom profiles
   - Calculates match percentage based on known symptom associations

2. **Location Factor (15% weight)**
   - Considers geographical disease prevalence
   - Accounts for regional health patterns and endemic conditions

3. **Seasonal Factor (15% weight)**
   - Incorporates current season in disease likelihood
   - Accounts for seasonal health patterns and climate-related conditions

### Confidence Scoring

- **High Confidence**: Score > 0.5 (Strong symptom match with location/season alignment)
- **Moderate Confidence**: Score 0.2-0.5 (Partial symptom match)
- **Low Confidence**: Score < 0.2 (Limited symptom correlation)

## Dataset Information

### Data Sources
The system utilizes multiple comprehensive datasets:

- **Disease Information**: 43 medical conditions with metadata
- **Symptom Database**: 4,900+ symptom records across various conditions
- **Training Data**: 1.4MB dataset with validated symptom-disease mappings
- **Treatment Data**: Evidence-based recommendations for medications, diet, and exercise

### Data Privacy
